This is a project of a "river raid" like game written in C.There are a lot of this I would like to change in this project, and Sprites are one of them for sure!! :DBut you can play it already, although it's very basic.I still want to complete this project some day...The next step is to implement or use a gun system, possibly using effects like particles.
